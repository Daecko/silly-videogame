                The game works! It is completed, now, if you play you'll notice that while you and yourself are playing,
                you can change the value of a tile after its been placed, this is intended, not lazy programming at all.
                This version will mantain the ASCII i used for testing so you can see the pre-final product, and then ill
                push the real version that will have that removed, this log as well and some other little changes. Next
                project will be another game, full vanilla as well, don't know when i'll start it. Cya.
