        <p>
            I wanted to let this project remain without personal comments
            but... I think that wont happen, because i really like to document
            my own progress and write my thoughts about it so, in order to
            try and keep this project clean, the last update for this
            will also remove this section. <br><br>
            I dont know yet what to expect from this, i just wanted to have another
            thing in my github, since i started from 0 because i think my school
            portfolio is not good enough to include in my cv... Maybe a tic tac toe,
            its not too serious but also not that simple, specially when talking about
            HTML+Javascript+CSS. I hope i complete this within... This week? 3 days? today? <br>
            Well, Soon... For now, you can place green squares inside the the canvas.
